# Black-Jack
This is a Black Jack game made in C++.
It is a very basic game with no special rules or tricks like splitting the deck and such. 
This uses a stack of pointers to represent the deck and a couple of other classes to make the main file more clean.
Up to four players and it is round based other than using a betting system.
